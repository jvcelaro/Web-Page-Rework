I did this work from a blog that I saw an individual wanting a frontend developer to restyle his page because it was very old from 2010, so I wanted to do this project with the intention of training where I left the link and photo of the individual's old page in case someone has already redone the page for him and challenged myself a little more also doing the back end of the page with node.
